# Railway Stalls Management System

## Project Overview

This is a **college project** I completed as part of the **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** course at **Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET), Patiala** during the **Jan-May 2024** semester.

The project focuses on building a structured **Railway Stalls Management System** using relational database design, SQL, and PL/SQL. It aims to enhance the railway station experience by enabling passengers to easily find and order from stalls, while also helping stall owners manage operations efficiently.

Roll No: 102203686  

## Key Features

- Stall listing with real-time availability  
- Platform-wise stall mapping  
- Train and passenger integration  
- Catalog for stall items (with pricing and stock status)  
- Procedures and functions for order, billing, and updates  
- Triggers to maintain data rules (e.g., max stalls per platform)  
- Normalized schema up to 3NF  
- ER Diagram and relational tables mapping  

## What It Includes

- ER Diagram  
- Normalized Tables (3NF)  
- SQL Table Creation Scripts  
- PL/SQL Procedures, Functions, and Triggers  
- Dummy Data Insertion  
- Functionalities like order tracking, status update, and inventory checks  

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Oracle SQL  
- PL/SQL  
- draw.io (for ER Diagram)  
- MS Word for documentation  
- DBMS concepts from textbooks and lectures  

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand how databases are structured, normalized, and queried in real-life scenarios. It shows how a well-designed database can optimize operations in complex environments like railway stations — benefiting both customers and service providers.

I’m proud of completing this as part of my college coursework and it reflects my learning in database systems, SQL, and data modeling.
